# Chapter 4, Vector Applications

## Key points

## Correlation

:::{.callout-note title="Definitions"}

- Correlation coefficient:
    - A scalar that uantifies the linear relationship between two variables.
    - [-1, 1]
:::

- Dot product with some normalizations:
    1. Mean centering: Subtracting the average value from each data value.
    2. Divide the dot product from the product of the vector norms. This allows one to cancel measurement units and scales.

- Familiar way:

$$
r = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1} (x_i - \bar{x_i})(y_i - \bar{y_i})}{\sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1} (x_i - \bar{x_i})^2} \sqrt{\sum^n_{i=1} (y_i - \bar{y_i})^2}}
$$

- Linear algebra way
$$
r = \frac{\tilde{x}^T\tilde{y}}{||\tilde{x}|| ||\tilde{y}||}
$$

where $\tilde{x}$ and $\tilde{y}$ are mean-centered vectors.

## Cosine similarity

- Alternative to way to assess similarity between vectors other than using correlation.
- Defined as the geometric formula for the dot product when solved for the cosine term.

$$
cos(\theta_{x,y}) = \frac{x^Ty}{||x|| ||y||}
$$

- The difference between this and correlation is that I am not first normalizing $x$ and $y$ by mean-centering them.
