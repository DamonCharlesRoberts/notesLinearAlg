## Key points

## Matrix Norms

::: {.callout-tip title="Recall"}
- Euclidean distance:
$$
  ||v|| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N v_i^2}
$$
- Vector norms:
  - A vector's Euclidean geometric length.
:::

- A matrix norm is not the same thing as a vector norm.
- Denoted as $\parallel A \parallel$
- Similar to vector norms in that each norm is a number that characterizes a matrix.
- Two main families of matrix norms:
  - Element-wise norms
    - Computed based on the individual elements of the matrix.
    - Reflect the magnitudes of the elements in the matrix.
  - Induced norms
    - One key function of a matrix is to encode transformations on a vector.
    - Given this, the induced norm of a matrix measures how much that transformation scales (stretches or shrinks) the vector.
## Euclidean norm (an example of a element-wise norm)
- AKA Frobenius norm or the $\mathcal{L}$ norm (the regularized norm)
$$
  \paralell A \parallel_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{j=1}^N a_{i,j}^2}
$$
- In words, it is the square root of the sum of all matrix elements squared.
- This norm in particular, but all norms, generally, are used quite a lot in machine learning and regularization.
- Also used as a measure of distance from another matrix, "Matrix Distance":
$$
C = A - B
$$
  - Where if $B=A$ then $C=0$ because the numerical values in the matrices are similar but if $B \neq A$ then $C$ increases when the numerical values get increasingly dissimilar.
