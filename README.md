# Personal notes for the book, *Practical Linear Algebra for Data Science* by Michael X. Cohen

My notes are published here: https://linalg.notes.Damoncroberts.io/

The book provides code exercises using `Python`. However, I am trying to get a bit better with `Julia`. So, the code examples here are using `Julia` and NOT `Python`.
